\begin{abstract*}

  In recent years processing power has become so cheap that making objects around us intelligent is no longer an issue: using energy-effective System-on-Chips or microcontrollers in clothes, furniture, toys, and other things helps to monitor our activity, store sensors' data, analyze it and share it to the Internet. Such smart things can interact with us using the embedded microphones, speakers and information displays. The rapid development of 5G- and 6G-networks in the near future will make it possible to provide a fast and energy-effective way to connect thousands of devices, no longer attached to one location. Higher data sharing between the devices and improved Big Data analysis leads to further evolution of Internet of Things. Developing new types of devices is an issue since there is no standard software for  their fast integration into real-world existing scenarios.
   
  In the meantime, Virtual Reality has seen rapid development recently, and with the newer techniques of hands recognition, as well as the evolution of Virtual Reality Headsets, it has proven itself as a great instrument not only for gaming purposes but for healthcare, education, and science.
   
  The author proposes a synchronization mechanism that keeps the real and virtual devices up-to-date, according to actions and events in the virtual world and vice-versa: actions applied on the real devices are transferred to the virtual world. In this dissertation, it is questioned if, with the help of Virtual Reality interaction devices, such mechanism can be developed and be used as a part of an instrument for research on new devices, and whether it is possible to extend real-world devices with extra virtual sensors and interactive objects.
  
  In this dissertation, a suitable architecture for this mechanism is proposed. By creating a prototype of the platform for seamless connection between real and virtual world, with a virtual representation of each Internet Of Things device parameters (data values) and two-way data transfer between real and virtual world, the performance of the system is evaluated, providing results for future development and consideration for future improvements. Although the platform is in the prototype stage, it has already been used by students of Tsinghua University for their projects.
