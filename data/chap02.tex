\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}


The literature review incorporates three sections: research on building an IoT platform without required support of VR, research on interacting with IoT devices in VR and AR, and, at last, research on creating an IoT-VR Platform.

\section{IoT device management}

Many companies already consider it profitable to use IoT in their businesses, but the establishing connection between heterogeneous IoT devices has not been solved yet. The existing frameworks that solve this issue seem to be usually not user-friendly and not easy to use. 

The providers of business IoT integration services state that their solutions can analyze large amounts of data from the connected IoT devices and then turn it into actionable insights (\cite{software_ag_software_2020}). Businesses can then use the insights for lowering energy consumption, analyzing the sensors data, etc.

Even if researchers can afford to pay a high price for getting the analyzed data, they still will not have access to the source code and access to the data used for training the models. Users will need to pay for the subscription to the services, and it will require additional time and money to switch to another solution.

In \cite{k_mohapatra_solution_2016} it is discussed how the framework for connecting heterogeneous devices should operate the incoming data. In this paper, the requirements for managing IoT are given: the communication protocols, security and access control, and how the data should be analyzed. In section 4 of the paper, a Reference IoT-Architecture model is proposed. Each solution block, such as Data Lake or Event Broker, is briefly introduced, but neither implementation nor tests are provided.

The IoT Architectural Framework, proposed in \cite{uviase_iot_2018}, is based on the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). This paradigm is used to minimize system integration problems, but when the number of services increases, the solution's performance can drop. In this paper, minimum measures for IoT framework to make the integration easier are proposed \footnote{These measures are used in the requirements for building a VR-IoT platform prototype, described in chapter 3 of this research.} Authors introduce several existing IoT frameworks following the SOA paradigm and propose their approach. As stated in the paper, the framework has not been implemented.  Nevertheless, the authors believe that the proposed framework can help the IoT community to understand how to solve the integration problem.

Compared to \cite{k_mohapatra_solution_2016}, in \cite{ahmad_software_2021} authors provide a deeper explanation of how to create an Internet Of Things Driven Data Analytics by using an evidence-based software engineering approach. The authors have created a criteria-based framework by evaluating different activities for the listed 17 Internet of Things Driven Data Analytics applications. As a result, each of the applications was assigned to a specific domain, such as Disaster Management or Environmental Monitoring. Even though each of the listed criteria fulfillment was satisfactory for at least one solution, none of the solutions can be considered universal. Still, they can be integrated into other solutions, as well as in the VR-IoT Research Platform.

In Chapter 1, it was mentioned how building 6G could influence the IoT market. In \cite{guo_enabling_2021} a comprehensive study was done, explaining how 5G limitations for massive IoT can be overcome by using 6G networks. It was explained how machine learning and blockchain could play the primary role in IoT ecosystems. New technologies can be supported, such as holographic communications, which can be easily tested in the VR-IoT Research Platform.

\section{Interaction with IoT devices in VR and AR}

Augmented reality is used to overlay digital objects onto the objects surrounding us in real life. Extra virtual elements can be attached to real-world devices. The selected research articles' main idea is to create a two-way synchronization between AR/VR and the real world: changes in the virtual world are applied to the real world and vice-versa.

Rendering digital devices for Augmented reality and Virtual reality is different: in Augmented reality, it is impossible to replace the element placed in the real world with a virtual one. Creating a Virtual reality environment similar to the real-world environment requires more time and effort than scanning objects to use them in Augmented reality. But, as a result, researchers can have more freedom, such as changing any object parameters. 
In \cite{ankireddy_augmented_2019} authors developed an image processing-based approach to control a specific device in real-world by pointing at it with their phone camera and pressing the button (turn the fan On and Off). Their solution is simple, but at the same time, it shows that it is possible to control IoT devices inside AR without using Mixed reality headsets, reducing the cost of the development. Similar results were achieved in \cite{jo_-situ_2016}, where a generic AR framework for managing IoT devices was proposed, and in \cite{alam_augmented_2017} for creating a safety system by viewing monitoring information on an AR device screen when pointing at the object.

One of the most popular Mixed reality headsets is Microsoft Hololens. The device developers provide API for hand tracking and spatial awareness (\cite{MRTK2021}). In \cite{sun_magichand_2019} authors proposed a Deep learning approach to create a tool for interacting with IoT devices using hand gestures registered by Hololens headset. 

Cities such as Shanghai, New York, Moscow can already be considered Smart cities because they have been implementing Smart solutions for several years. Using Augmented and Virtual reality can help in creating IoT solutions for such Smart cities and networks, as reported in \cite{chakareski_uav-iot_2019} and \cite{carneiro_bim_2018}. As for other domains, in \cite{paul_role_2019} it was shown how AR and VR, combined with IoT, could be used for Smart education, and in \cite{jang_building_2019-1}, for energy management. In sum, using AR and VR for managing IoT has been proven to be effective.

\section{IoT-VR platforms}

This research could have had no novelty if a solution for creating new IoT devices inside VR already existed. Fortunately, none of the following articles is focused on providing such a platform. Nonetheless, they are still helpful for the VR-IoT platform development.

The next-generation network will influence the IoT market, as stated previously. In \cite{liao_information-centric_2021}, authors provide their solution for integrating AR/VR inside 6G massive IoT environment.

As mentioned in the previous section, using VR for IoT research requires building a virtual environment. Nowadays, most VR headsets provide 6 degrees of freedom, which means that it is possible to simultaneously move in the real world and virtual world. In \cite{you_internet_2018} authors research on how IoT can be applied for seamless virtual reality space created by 360-degree photos and videos.

In \cite{myeong-in_choi_design_2017}, \cite{simiscuka_synchronisation_2018}, \cite{simiscuka_real-virtual_2019} and \cite{krishnan_performance_2020} VR-IoT platforms were proposed, but none of the articles is focused on implementing a universal solution, which can be used for developing new devices in the VR-IoT environment. Instead, only demos for particular devices were implemented.

Finally, \cite{hu_virtual_2021} provided research on the VR headsets market and introduced several VR-IoT environment applications. The authors mainly focused on VR streaming solutions.

Overall, various examples of using VR for IoT were proposed in the literature. The collected information can be summarized into the following insights:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item IoT market nowadays is diverse. There are applications for most of the domains for Smart environments, but no universal solution exists;
   \item The SOA paradigm can be applied for creating an IoT platform to minimize the integration problems;
    \item 6G networks will enable using new types of IoT devices based on Deep Learning and blockchain. The increased network speed will allow more advanced IoT interaction and Data Analysis;
    \item AR can enrich operation with real-world IoT devices by layering extra data on top of them. Detection of the IoT devices in AR can be performed using smartphone cameras for lowering the costs;
    \item Synchronization between real IoT devices and their virtual copies is possible with relatively low latency for a local-based approach.
\end{enumerate}

In the next Chapter, the VR-IoT platform requirements are defined, and the prototype is introduced.
