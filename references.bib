Energy demand management is becoming more important to solve these problems. The energy industry is actively utilizing IoT technology in accordance with the paradigm shift. Building Energy Management System (BEMS) uses IoT technology to monitor power consumption and data about space environment in building in numerical or graph form.

We characterize the delivered immersion ﬁdelity as a function of the assigned UAV-IoT capture/network rates and study the optimization problem of maximizing it, for given system/application constraints. We explore fast reinforcement learning to discover the best dynamic UAV-IoT network placement over the scene of interest to maximize the expected remote immersion ﬁdelity. We design scalable source-channel viewpoint coding to maximize the expected reconstruction ﬁdelity of the data captured at every UAV location at the ground-based aggregation point. Finally, we explore layered directional networking and rate-distortionpower optimized embedded scheduling methods to effectively transmit the encoded data and overcome network transients that lead to packet buffering, which represent the fourth system component of our framework. Experimental results demonstrate considerable performance efﬁciency gains enabled by each system component over the respective state-of-the-art reference methods, in delivered VR immersion ﬁdelity, application interactivity/playout latency, and transmission power consumption.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) based IoT prototype system. Performing maintenance tasks in a complex environment is quite challenging and diﬃcult due to complex, and possibly, underground facilities, uneasy access, human factors, heavy machineries, etc. Current technology is not acceptable because of signiﬁcant delays in communication and data transmission, missing multi-input interfaces, and simultaneous supervision of multiple workers who are working in the extreme environment. The aim is to technically advance and combine several technologies and integrate them as integral part of a personnel safety system to improve safety, maintain availability, reduce errors and decrease the time needed for scheduled or ad hoc interventions. We emphasize on the aspects that were made “feasible” on the worker's side due to the equipment used (mobile computing equipment). We present that the demanding tasks that previously were simply undertaken on the ﬁxed infrastructure are now possible on the mobile end. The research challenges lie in the development of real-time data-transmission, instantaneous analysis of data coming from diﬀerent inputs, local intelligence in low power embedded systems, interaction with multiple on-site users, complex user interfaces, portability and wearability. This work is part EDUSAFE, a Marie Curie ITN (Initial Training Network) project focusing on research into the use of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) during planned and ad hoc maintenance in extreme work environments.},

However, limited research exists on how IoT-DA applications are designed, implemented, operationalised, and evolved in the context of software and system engineering life-cycle. This article empirically derives a framework that could be used to systematically investigate the role of software engineering (SE) processes and their underlying practices to engineer IoT-DA applications. First, using existing frameworks and taxonomies, we develop an evaluation framework to evaluate software processes, methods, and other artefacts of SE for IoT-DA. Secondly, we perform a systematic mapping study to qualitatively select 16 processes (from academic research and industrial solutions) of SE for IoT-DA. Thirdly, we apply our developed evaluation framework based on 17 distinct criterion (a.k.a. process activities) for fine-grained investigation of each of the 16 SE processes. Fourthly, we apply our proposed framework on a case study to demonstrate development of an IoT-DA healthcare application. Finally, we highlight key challenges, recommended practices, and the lessons learnt based on framework’s support for process-centric software engineering of IoT-DA. The results of this research can facilitate researchers and practitioners to engineer emerging and next-generation of IoT-DA software applications.},

A synchronisation mechanism keeps the real devices up-to-date, according to actions and events that happened in the virtual world and vice-versa: actions applied on the real devices are transferred to the virtual world.

The Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as systems-on-achip (e.g. Raspberry Pi), smart appliances, and sensors support a wide range of services, including machine automation, and remote monitoring and control. This paper introduces a novel social VR-IoT environment, which allows users to share and control local or remote IoT devices in a virtual platform. Two approaches using the VR-IoT solution are presented: one local network-based and one cloud-based. The proposed VR-IoT environment contains VRITESS, the novel VR-IoT Environment Synchronization Scheme, which facilitates a consistent and integrated experience for users by enabling control of real IoT objects with VR headsets. The control of some IoT objects in extreme environments or devices which are complex to operate can be simpliﬁed in a virtual environment. The VRITESS synchronization scheme maintains the real objects updated following instructions given in the virtual world and vice-versa. Testing involved local network-based and cloud-based testbeds created with a VR headset and IoT devices with the Performance Engineering Laboratory, Dublin City University’s, Ireland. Test results demonstrated that lower latency is experienced in the local-network testbed in comparison with the cloud testbed. Furthermore, tests regarding the communications protocols implemented in the cloud testbed indicated that MQTT generates less delay and data trafﬁc than REST.},

Today, smart IoT devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous with diverse forms and functions, yet most user controls over them are still limited to mobile devices and web interfaces. Recently, AR has been developed rapidly, and provided immersive solutions to enhance user experience of applications in many ﬁelds. Its capability to create immersive interactions allows AR to improve the way smart devices are controlled via more direct visual feedback. In this paper, we create a functional prototype of one such system, enabling seamless interactions with sound and lighting systems through the use of augmented hand-controlled interaction panels. To interpret users’ intentions, we implement a standard 2D convolution neural network (CNN) for real-time hand gesture recognition and deploy it within our system. Our prototype is also equipped with a simple but effective object detector which can identify target devices within a proper range by analyzing geometric features. We evaluate the performance of our system qualitatively and quantitatively and demonstrate it on two smart devices.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a novel virtual reality (VR) system that is based on the real world in which we live. The ultimate goal is to implement it as though a VR user freely exists in a place. To this end, it is most important to reconstruct a VR space that provides six degree-of-freedom (DOF), namely, yaw, pitch, roll, surge, sway, and heave. However, most currently released VR services that are based on the real world limit users’ movements to three DOF. Even if the services support six DOF, most are highly complex and based on computer graphics. To overcome this problem, we ﬁrst assume that there is a full Internet of things (IoT) infrastructure for collecting important data for VR space reconstruction. This assumption is realistic because many researchers expect that in the near future, IoT technology will lead to a world that connects not only people to people but also things to things. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system architecture for the VR space that is based on the real world along with the element technologies that constitute the proposed system. This paper also includes a detailed survey of both conventional and emerging studies by other researchers.},

One very characteristic of this information is its geographic nature, which suggests that Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are appropriate to facilitate the way we handle it. However, the access to such information nowadays is challenging because of numerous reasons: some data is still mainly stored on paper; databases are out of date; managing scarcely existing records and creating new ones is quite a laborious and time-consuming task; ﬁeld inspections require human resources and are expensive; and so forth. Thus, we need to make smarter the way management and maintenance of road infrastructures are performed. Some promising technologies appeared in the last few years to overcome a number of the identiﬁed issues. This paper presents and discusses on the most prominent work efforts aiming at more intelligent management of the city infrastructures, specially focusing on transport networks. Several of such efforts use Geographic Information Systems, Building Information Modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) technologies. Thus, this study emphasizes on the GIS-BIM-IoT and GIS-BIM-VR/AR integrations showing the possibilities and potentials when these technologies work together.},

	abstract = {The development of massive IoT has not only brought about a wealth of hardware resources but also brought about the problems of difﬁcult data management, resource running and low efﬁciency. The emergence of sixth-generation (6G) network will not only provide faster data rates, more device connections but also bring ubiquitous virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) services. In the 6G era, large-scale IoT devices will generate VR/AR service and resource requirements, and the network will also face unprecedented pressure to respond to the ubiquitous VR/AR requirements. To address the above issues, this article proposes the information-centric massive Internet of Things (IC-mIoT) suitable for 6G large-scale VR/AR content distribution to improve the efﬁciency of IC-mIoT and fully guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) of users. First, this article introduces the blockchain for IC-mIoT nodes and proposes a new consensus mechanism Proof-of-Cache-Ofﬂoading (PoCO). Second, an architecture using blockchain-enabled IC-mIoT for VR/AR is proposed in this article. The massive IoT resources are fully integrated and scheduled to support large-scale VR/AR applications and IC-mIoT. Third, a Stackelberg game model and a cache index selection and calculation algorithm are formulated for blockchain-enabled cache ofﬂoading. The analysis and performance simulation results indicate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, many disruptive Internet of things (IoT) applications emerge, such as augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) online games, autonomous driving, and smart everything, which are massive in number, data-intensive, computation-intensive, and delay-sensitive. Due to the mismatch between the ﬁfth generation (5G) and the requirements of such massive IoT-enabled applications, there is a need for technological advancements and evolutions for wireless communications and networking toward the sixth generation (6G) networks. 6G is expected to deliver extended 5G capabilities at a very high level, such as Tbps data rate, sub-ms latency, cm-level localization, and so on, which will play a signiﬁcant role in supporting massive IoT devices to operate seamlessly with highly diverse service requirements. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on 6G-enabled massive IoT. First, we present the drivers and requirements by summarizing the emerging IoT-enabled applications and the corresponding requirements, along with the limitations of 5G. Second, visions of 6G are provided in terms of core technical requirements, use cases, and trends. Third, a new network architecture provided by 6G to enable massive IoT is introduced, i.e., space-air-groundunderwater/sea networks enhanced by edge computing. Fourth, some breakthrough technologies, such as machine learning and blockchain, in 6G are introduced, where the motivations, applications, and open issues of these technologies for massive IoT are summarized. At last, a use case of fully autonomous driving is presented to show 6G supports massive IoT.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing network of physical objects where the devices are connected to the Internet through unique addressing schemes and multiple protocols. The increase of IoT devices in the recent years presents signiﬁcant challenges in terms of security, authentication and usability. The recently introduced Social Internet of Things (SIoT) tries to address these challenges with the virtualisation of IoT devices and the use of an infrastructure where people and IoT devices can communicate with each other, both in the real-world and virtual-world, through a common platform. In the proposed SIoT architecture, IoT devices can be operated by virtual reality (VR) headsets and Twitter, a social media platform. The aim of the platform is to allow users to seamlessly operate IoT devices, using their preferred interface: remotely with text messages (i.e. tweets) and VR headsets or operate the IoT devices directly. This paper also describes the implementation of a testbed and presents the performance analysis of the solution, demonstrating its feasibility and low latency.},
